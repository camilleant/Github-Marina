## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r table, echo=FALSE}

table(park24$scove)
nasum<-sum(is.na(park24$inclevel[park24$scove==1]))
allsum<-sum(park24$scove==1)
summary <- park24 %>%
  filter(scove == 1) %>%
  group_by(inclevel) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    count = n(),
    percent = n()/(allsum-nasum)
  )
print(summary, n=21)

```
